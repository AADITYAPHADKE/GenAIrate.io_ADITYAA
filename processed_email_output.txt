BODY:
Hi Aditya,

These are 4 examples of the data you would be dealing with. These are the .eml files. And you would need send these to an LLM to extract the following information:
1. Property Damage
2. Business Interruption
3. Total Insured Value
4. Deductibles
5. Sublimits
6. Address of Location or Locations
7. Claims if there is any

To start with you can extract these and see how it goes. I will send over the API keys towards the end of the week.

Hello Adnan Labib,

I hope you are doing well.

Apologies for the late notice. I have a meeting scheduled from 11:00 to 11:20 with Yogesh Joshee that overlaps with our meeting.

May I kindly request if our meeting could be rescheduled to a later time at your convenience? I sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Thanks & Regards
Aditya Phadke
